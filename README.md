🌆 Smart City Dashboard – Traffic & Air Quality Prediction
📌 Overview

This project is an interactive Smart City Dashboard built with Streamlit, combining:

🚦 Traffic congestion prediction

🌫️ Air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, O₃) forecasting

🌍 Geospatial visualization using Folium maps and heatmaps

The app collects real-world open data (traffic, air quality, weather), applies machine learning models (Random Forest, Prophet), and visualizes results on an interactive city map.

It demonstrates data science + geospatial analysis + deployment — making it a unique portfolio project.

✨ Features

📡 Fetch live air quality data from OpenAQ API

📈 Forecast PM2.5 levels for the next 24 hours

🗺️ Visualize pollution hotspots with Folium Heatmaps

🚗 Upload sample traffic data (CSV) and generate congestion predictions

📊 Model evaluation with MAE, RMSE, R²

🌐 Deployable on Streamlit Cloud
